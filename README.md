This is a sample sniffer based on Libpcap, which is based on Berkeley Packet Filter. I extract some code from Libpcap and tcpdump. By the way, it helps me a lot after i read the source code of tcpdump.
This sniffer isn't perfect, in other words, it's ugly. Cause i have only implemented few protocols.
But you know, the idea is the same. So, it will not be difficult if you wanna develop this sniffer.
